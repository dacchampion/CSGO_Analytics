# CSGO_Analytics
Whole analytics for counter strike games by DreamTeam

There are three notebooks in this repository where the statistical analysis was carried out.

  1. CSGO Game Analysis: Initial dataset exploration and extraction of basic statistic descriptors
  2. CSGO PCA and Linear regression on win rate descriptor: In addition a cluster analysis was carried out
  3. Multivariable linear regression, kmeans analysis and TSNE multidimensional reduction

It has to be pointed out that the data is private but a description of the source is that it was delivered in
PostgresSQL and then each table analized individually.
